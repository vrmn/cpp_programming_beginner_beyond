Here we'll tak about keywords, identifiers, punction operators and syntax in programming

Most languages have keywords. Keywords are part of the vocabulary of a programming language.
In most languages the keywords are reserved. This means that you, the programmer, cannot redefine their meaning
and you cannot use them in a way which they were unintended.

There are around 90 keywords in c++
java has around 50
c has around 32
python has around 33

In general the more keywords that a language has, the more complex the programming language grammar.

------------------------

In codelite you will see the keywords highlighted a certain color, such as int and return.

The others like std::cout, std::cin are known as identifiers.

There's an important distinction between identifiers and keywords.

- an identifier is something that the programmer names. these names have been created by programmer to create   
  something that represents something meaningful to them.

-----------------------

c++ also has a lot of operators such as + * - /
some standard operators in c++ are << string insertion,  >> stringextraction.

<< string insertion operator, were going to insert whatever is on the right hand side of it into that stream. in this case it's an output stream that gets displayed to the console.

>> string extraction operator which takes something from the console and stores it into a variable  


:: scope resolution operator.


---------------

c++ also has punctuation things like ; at the end of the statements {} and ""

---------------------

the combination of all the above makes up what is called syntax ( the structure and meaning) in a programs
The syntax of the programming language ( the structure and the meaning of what you want the compiler to understand. )
The compiler is taking your code and translating it to machine code and it's translated here based on what you told it you wanted to be done.
