so lets say we dont have an IDE. Just a text editor and a terminal. How to compile and run cpp program.

welp its as simple as typing out (correctly your cpp script) then on terminal to compile just type

g++ -Wall -std=c++14 <name of cpp file> -o <name of executable no .ccp needed>

this will generate the executable.

To run it simply type ./<name of executable>
