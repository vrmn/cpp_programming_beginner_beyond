recall  building means compiling, linking together with extra libraries and external files if we need to
and creating an executive file, thats what building is all about


in codelite you can right click and compile project or in build comoile

right click on project theres options like clean

when compiling a c++ program you are converting the source code ( the main.cpp script for example) to an object format. which is a machine language or binary format
this creates a dot o file or a dot obj  .o / .obj

------------------

clean process removes all object files. Sometimes you want a clean build
